====================

Project: Warehouse AI Assistant (RAG-based System)
Architecture: Streamlit + Ollama (Gemma3) + ChromaDB + CSV Inventory Dataset
Embedding Model: mxbai-embed-large
Retriever: Top-K (k=10)

--------------------------------------------------
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------
• 10 warehouse-related prompts were tested.
• Questions were asked through the Streamlit interface.
• Retriever fetched relevant records from ChromaDB.
• Ollama LLM generated responses strictly based on retrieved data.
• Accuracy was measured by comparing responses with actual CSV records.

--------------------------------------------------
TEST CASES
--------------------------------------------------

1. Prompt: What is the available quantity of ProductID 101?
   Expected: Matches CSV Quantity column
   LLM Response: Correct value retrieved
   Accuracy: ✅ Correct

2. Prompt: Which supplier provides Category Electronics items?
   Expected: Supplier from CSV
   LLM Response: Correct supplier identified
   Accuracy: ✅ Correct

3. Prompt: List products below reorder level.
   Expected: Items where Quantity < ReorderLevel
   LLM Response: Correct filtered items
   Accuracy: ✅ Correct

4. Prompt: What is the unit price of Product XYZ?
   Accuracy: ✅ Correct

5. Prompt: Which warehouse stores ProductID 205?
   Accuracy: ✅ Correct

6. Prompt: Show last updated date of Product ABC.
   Accuracy: ✅ Correct

7. Prompt: What is the total stock for Category Furniture?
   Accuracy: ⚠ Partially Correct (LLM provided individual records, not aggregated total)

8. Prompt: Identify products at risk of stockout.
   Accuracy: ✅ Correct (Based on reorder logic)

9. Prompt: Which products are supplied by Supplier A?
   Accuracy: ✅ Correct

10. Prompt: Provide summary of Electronics inventory.
    Accuracy: ⚠ Partially Correct (Summary provided but not numerical aggregation)

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------

Total Fully Correct: 8/10
Partially Correct: 2/10
Incorrect: 0/10

Overall Accuracy Score: 90%

--------------------------------------------------
OBSERVATIONS
--------------------------------------------------

• Retrieval quality is strong due to structured document creation.
• LLM follows prompt constraints ("Use ONLY inventory data provided").
• Aggregation queries (sum, total) require additional computation logic.
• System performs reliably for lookup-based and filter-based queries.

--------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------

The Warehouse AI Assistant demonstrates high accuracy in record retrieval
and factual response generation. Minor limitations exist in aggregation
queries due to absence of explicit numerical computation logic.

System Reliability: HIGH
Deployment Readiness: Academic / Prototype Level
